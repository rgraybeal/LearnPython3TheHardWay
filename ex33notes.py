While loops


while-loops keep looping as long as a boolean expression is True

Avoiding infinite Loops
1. make sure that you use while- loops sparingly. Using a for-loop is better.
2. Revew your while staemtns and make sure that hte boolean test will become False at some point
3. When in doubt, print out your test variable at the top and bottom of the while-loop to see what it's doing

-------------------------------------

git commands:
git add "FileName" -A is all, . is all as well
git status
git commit -m "Give it a message."
git push
git pull to take off git and place on computer
-----------------------------------------------
ESC : wq to get out of a full-blown commit



Workflow
1. at beginning of day, start with git pull
2. make your changes, git Add -A
3. git commit -m "made mortar more specific"
Multiple times a day

Level up tutorial - install a git package that allows git commands in the text edit window
